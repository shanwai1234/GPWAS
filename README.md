# Data Preparation

All of input data are required to be organized in following format.

## Genotype Data

**Gene**: Keep the title of this item as "Gene" and do not change it. All of gene names were kept below it.

**SNP**: Keep the title of this item as "SNP" and do not change it. The format of SNP should be written as "S"+chromosome+"\_"+SNP position.

**Sample**: Individual sample name. 

**Note**: All items should be split by \tab

| Gene | SNP | Sample1 | Sample2 | Sample3 |
| :---: | :---: |:---: |:---: | :---: |
|Zm00001d000501|S3_27396852| 0 | 1 | 0 |
|Zm00001d000501|S3_27397388| 0 | 2 | 1 |
|Zm00001d000632|S3_156234383| 0 | 1 | 1 |
|Zm00001d000632|S3_156234434| 1 | 2 | 1 |
|Zm00001d000654|S3_178548901| 2 | 1 | 1 |

## Phenotype Data

**Pheno** Name of phenotype name.

**Sample** Individual sample name.

**Note**: All items should be split by space.

| Taxa | Pheno1 | Pheno2 | Pheno3 |
| :---: | :---: |:---: |:---: |
| Sample1 | 23 | 50 | 55 |
| Sample2 | 10 | 12 | 8 |
| Sample3 | 120 | 150 | 133 |

## PC covariates
Version 1.0.1 GPWAS package controls population structure using PC scores generated by PCA. For each individual gene, population structure is controlled by PC scores calculated by the rest of other chromosomes. But generating PC scores were not included in GPWAS package. You are suggested to calculate it using function like [prcomp](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/prcomp.html).

|  | "PC1" | "PC2" | "PC3" |
| :---: | :---: |:---: |:---: |
| "Sample1" | -11 | 8 | 31 |
| "Sample2" | -36 | 35 | 138 |
| "Sample3" | 15 | 10 | -7 |

**Note**: All items should be split by space. The order of samples should be identical to the order of samples in both genotype and phenotype file.
